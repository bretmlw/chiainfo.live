This repo hosts the output of a very, very simple script I have running to output the `chia netspace` command via the chia CLI and push it to Cloudflare Pages. I'll look at making it prettier and adding some other features at some point, maybe.

If there's any particular feature you'd like to see on the page then feel free to raise an issue/suggestion.
